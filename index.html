								<b>Parameters of 220 million stars from Gaia BP/RP spectra </b>
								<br>

							Gaia DR3 contains low-resolution XP spectra of over 220 million stars, giving a unique opportunity to measure 								dust extinction and its vatiation in 3D.
							<br>
							We build a forward model that maps (Teff, [Fe/H], logg) to Gaia XP, and ultilize this model to determine the 								<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7692681" style="color: red;"> stellar types, extinction and distances for 								all 220 million Gaia XP stars</a>.
							<br>
							For more details, please take a look at <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.1855Z/abstract" style="color: red;">
							our paper</a>.

							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Variation of dust extinction in the milky way</b>
							<br>
							The variation of dust extinction is modelled by the parmeter Rv = A(V)/E(B-V) , which is determined by the 								size distribution and chemical composition of the interstellar dust. Dust Rv is an also important tracer of local 								physical and chemical environment, such as SNe, star formation and molecular clouds.
							<br>
							Ultilizing Gaia XP spectra, we determine Rv for ~ 130 million high-extinction stars, which would be <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11394477" style="color: red;"> one of the largest Rv catalog </a> up to 2024. This paper is under review,  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.1855Z/abstract" style="color: red;"> arXiv:2407.14594 </a>
							<br>
						
							<p>

							<b> Physical explanation of R(V) </b><br>

							We discover exciting correlation of Rv and are currently working on explaining them.
